### Installation
  
<!-- You can install the released version of CPxplorer from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("CPxplorer") -->
<!-- ``` -->
  

To install this R package directly from Github:  
``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WBS-TW/CPxplorer")

```
  
After installation, attach the package by:  
``` r
library(CPxplorer)
```
  
These functions will then be available:  
`CPions()`: opens a shiny app to generate ions of PCAs and analogues.  
`CPquant()`: opens a shiny app to analyze and quantify output from Skyline.  
  
  
Server versions is available at shinyapp.io (this is a free tier account and therefore subjected to monthly limit for the server calculations):   
CPions: https://wbs-tw.shinyapps.io/CPions20250218/  
CPquant: https://wbs-tw.shinyapps.io/CPquant20250218/  
  
  
The apps can also be opened directly in a web browser of the local computer from these sites (no need to install the R package):  
  
https://wbs-tw.github.io/CPions_Shinylive/  
https://wbs-tw.github.io/CPquant_Shinylive/  _(currently Shinylive cannot export all results to excel, and the user is referred to the other versions for this functionality)_
